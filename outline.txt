Fun with anchor tags
====================

*   prevent the link from getting followed
*   extract the href out of the anchor tags
*   load it into the dom

My favorite jquery UI components
================================

*   dialog
*   datepicker
*   autocomplete
*   slider

Deferred objects
================

*   Set a callback to fire after all the async objects finish
    *   dojo version
    *   jquery version

Dojo publish subscribe and jquery custom events
===============================================

*   We need a way for different events to communicate with each other.
*   Dojo offers publish / subscribe
*   jquery offers custom events
*   Fun dojo fact: subscribing after publish happens will get the event

Performance discoveries
=======================

*   DTL is often fine, sometimes nightmarish
*   Break pages down so that you can pull in chunks of the page via ajax
*   $.load is great, but avoid using a selector at the end
*   $.find is a resource pig
